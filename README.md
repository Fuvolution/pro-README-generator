# Pro README Generator

## Description:
I refactored the starter code, so whenever the user runs the command 'node index.js' on the command line, 
this application will ask the user a couple of questions regarding their project. After the user answers every 
question, this application will generate a professional README.md file that displays these information the user 
entered! This application allows users to quickly generate professional README files by only answering a couple of 
questions!
